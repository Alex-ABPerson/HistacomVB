The developed, VB version of TimeHACK/Histacom
THE LEAD DEVELOPER OF THIS IS NOT AShifter

I'M (Alex) THE NEW LEAD DEVELOPER OF THIS.
IF YOU WANT TO ASK ME ANYTHING IT WOULD BE BEST IF YOU COULD GO ONTO THE TIMEHACK DISCORD
(Go to the Timehack forums and you can find the link there - http://www.ashifter.ml/timehack/forum/index.php?sid=1ae8188acd8195fada42f0ce3a82e636)

THEN MESSAGE ME ON DISCORD AND IF THE QUESTION IS GOOD ENOUGH I WILL PUT IT PUBLIC ON THE TIMEHACK FORUMS.

FINALLY - MY NAME ON GITHUB IS Alex-TIMEHACK and on Discord it is just Alex

---------------------- VERY IMPORTANT ----------------------  
May I just point out that AShifter also helped with this
By owning the repo and commiting the source. Not to mention the AppVeyor (WHEN/IF THAT'S SET UP)
------------------------------------------------------------

Enjoy!
